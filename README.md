 Predicting Hot Events in the Early Period Through Bayesian Model for Social Networks

##  Overview

"Predicting Hot Events in the Early Period Through Bayesian Model for Social Networks" is a final-year academic project that aims to identify viral or "hot" events in their early stages on social media platforms using a Bayesian statistical model. 

This project is built using Java (J2EE) for the backend, MySQL for data storage, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend interface. It allows users to input early engagement metrics such as likes, shares, and comments, and predicts whether the event will go viral.

##  Objectives

- Analyze early engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments)
- Predict the probability of an event going viral using Bayesian inference
- Display predictions with a clean and responsive user interface
